# Gazebo & Rviz simulation
This third assignment consists in a robot simulation based on ROS environment and in c++ language. Gazibo and Rviz environment has been downloaded from [Prof. Carmine Recchiuto's repository](https://github.com/CarmineD8/final_assignment) for Robotics Engineering students of UNIGE.

Some parameters has been already set in [slam_gmapping package](https://github.com/CarmineD8/slam_gmapping) needed for this simulation.

## Installing and running
At first, install the above packages in your ROS workspace by executing in terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/CarmineD8/final_assignment
git clone https://github.com/CarmineD8/slam_gmapping
```
Since ROS noetic is used, make sure to also have the 'ros navigation stack' installed by executing:
```
apt-get install ros-noetic-navigation
```
Switch on the noetic branch of the packeges by executing:
```
git checkout noetic
```
At last, download this package and build the workspace by executing `catkin_make` command.

Now, to run the simulation digit respectively in three different terminals:
```
roslaunch final_assignment simulation_gmapping
roslaunch final_assignment move_base
rosrun final_assignment interface_node
```
Gazebo and Rviz environment is now available.

## Assignment
For this assignment a software architecture for the control of the robot is developed. This architecture is defined as an user interface that takes user requests and then execute the corresponding controlling mode. There are three different robot control modalities:
* autonomously reach a position in the environment passed as input by the user
* the user takes full control of the robot and drives it with the keyboard
* the user takes control of the robot, but it is assisted to avoid collisions

This interface is developed as a node that subscribes and publish to different topics and it implements different functions for every modality.
The following flowcharts describe the scripts of one possible solution implemented:

## Simulation topics used
### Reach new goal ###
By publishing in `move_base/goal` topic, the user can give (x,y) position of the target he wants the robot to reach. For this purpouse the user need to access to the following fields of the topic:
* *goal*
* *target_pose* 
* *pose*
* *position*
And then the following fields can be modify:
* *x*,*y*: target new coordinates

This topic type is `move_base_msgs/MoveBaseActionGoal`.

### Goal status ###
By subscribing to `move_base/status` topic, the node has access to many fields among which `status_list` is used to get information about the state of the goal. In this boolean array two elements are important:
* *SUCCEDED*: is 1 whenever the goal is satisfied
* *REJECTED*: is 1 whenever the goal is unreachable

This topic type is `actionlib_msgs/GoalStatusArray`.

### Cancel goal ###
By publishing in `move_base/cancel` topic, the current goal can be cancelled both by the user and if the goal is unreachable. It only need to publish an ampty request.

This topic type is `actionlib_msgs/GoalID`.

### Scanning obstacles ###
By subscribing to the `scan` topic, the node has access to many fields among which `rages` is used to get the information needed: it is an array of 721 elements which contains the distances from the nearest obstacles in a [0 180]Â° vision range.

This topic type is `sensor_msgs::LaserScan`.

### Velocity ###
By publishing into the `/cmd_vel` topic, the node can modify its fields:
* *linear*: linear velocity array
  * *x*,*y*: direction of the linear velocity
* *angular*: angular velocity array
  * *z*: direction of the angular velocity 

This topic type is `geometry_msgs::Twist`.
